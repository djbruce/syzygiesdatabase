	<p>
	We approach the problem of computing syzygies of \(\mathbb{P}^n\) via computing the cohomology of the Koszul complex. Continuing
	the notation from <a href="">Background</a> page \(K_{p,q}(n,b;d)\) may be computed as the cohomology of the complex:
	\[\bigwedge^{p+1}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+(q-1)d}\xrightarrow{\quad \partial_{p+1} \quad}\bigwedge^{p}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+qd}\rightarrow{\quad \partial_{p} \quad}\bigwedge^{p-1}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+(q+1)d},\]
	where the differentials are given by
	\[\partial_{p}(m_1\wedge m_2\wedge \cdots \wedge m_p\otimes f)=\sum_{k=1}^p(-1)^km_1\wedge m_2\wedge \cdots \wedge \hat{m}_{k}\wedge \cdots \wedge m_p\otimes(m_kf).\]
	Note these differentials respect the \(\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}\)-grading on \(S\), and so the above complex may be decomposed into its
	multigraded stands, and so we may compute \(K_{p,q}(n,b;d)_{\textbf{a}}\) via the cohomology of the following subcomplex:
	\[\left(\bigwedge^{p+1}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+(q-1)d}\right)_{\textbf{a}}\xrightarrow{\quad \partial_{p+1,\textbf{a}} \quad}\left(\bigwedge^{p}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+qd}\right)_{\textbf{a}}\rightarrow{\quad \partial_{p,\textbf{a}} \quad}\left(\bigwedge^{p-1}S_{d}\otimes S_{b+(q+1)d}\right)_{\textbf{a}}.\]
	Thus, computing the multigraded Betti numbers \(\beta_{p,\textbf{a}}(n,b;d)\) reduces to the linear algebra problem of computing
	the ranks of \(\partial_{p+1,\textbf{a}}\) and \(\partial_{p+1,\textbf{a}}\).

	We denote the \(k\)th graded piece of \(S\) by \(S_k\). Now for any \(b\in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(d\in\mathbb{N}\) we let
	\[ S(b;d):= \bigoplus_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}S_{dk+b}\subset S\]
	which we think of as an \(R=\text{Sym}(S_d)\)-module. Notice that \(S(b;d)\) corresponds to the pushforward of the 
	sheaf \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(b)\) by the \(d\)'uple embedding of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).

	</p>
	Understanding the Betti numbers of \(S(b;d)\) amounts, in essence, to understanding \(\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\mathbb{C})\)
	as a graded \(R\)-module. Usually by "graded" one means the \(\mathbb{Z}\) these \(\text{Tor}\) modules inherit from the 
	standard grading on \(S\). However, in our work there turns out to be three different, although related, gradings we find it
	fruitful to consider. We briefly describe each below:

	As mentioned above \(\text{Tor}^R(S(b;d),\mathbb{C})\) inherits a natural \(\mathbb{Z}\)-grading from the
	standard grading on \(S\). This gives rise to the<b>standard graded Betti number</b> of \(S(b;d)\) which one may define by:
	\[\beta_{p,q}(S(b;d)):=\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\mathbb{C})_{q}.\]
	Note while this notation is quite standard, for easy of notation as well as other applications 
	it is often easier to work with the <b> Koszul cohomology groups</b> of \(S(b;d)\), which are defined to be:
	\[K_{p,q}(S(b;d))=\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\mathbb{C})_{p+q}.\]
	Notice knowing these Koszul cohomology groups is equivalent to know the standard graded
	Betti numbers since \(\dim K_{p,q}(n,b;d)\) is equal to \(\beta_{p,p+q}(n,b;d)\). The (graded) 
	<b> Betti table</b> of \(S(b;d)\) is the matrix who's \((p,q)\) entry is \(\dim K_{p,q}(n,b;d)\).

      			The polynomial ring \(S\) carries an action of the general linear group \(\textbf{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\), which
      			in turns gives \(S\) a \(\mathbb{Z}^3\)-grading. <a tabindex="0" class="btn btn-xs btn-info"data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus"data-popover-content="#remark1">Rmk</a>
      			We call this the <b>Schur grading</b> and it descends to \(\text{Tor}^{R}(S(b;d),\mathbb{C})\). Moreover, since this action is degree preserving this grading
      			further descends to the Koszul cohomology groups. We call the resulting decomposition the <b>Schur decomposition</b> of \(K_{p,q}(n,b;d\).
      			Since the irreducible representations of \(\textbf{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\) are given (up to isomorphisms) Schur functors,
      			we can write the Schur decomposition of \(K_{p,q}(n,b;d)\) can be expressed as:
      			\[K_{p,q}(n,b;d)=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in\mathbb{Z}^3}\textbf{S}_{\lambda}(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^{\oplus \beta_{p,\lambda}(n,b;d)},\]
      			 where \(\textbf{S}_{\lambda}\) is a Schur functor and \(\lambda\) has weight \(d(p+q)+b\). <a tabindex="0" class="btn btn-xs btn-info"data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus"data-popover-content="#remark2">Rmk</a>

      			<p>The final grading we will make use of is the \(\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}\)-multigrading on \(S\) that arrises either
      			by letting \(\text{deg}(x_i)=\textbf{e}_i\) where \(\textbf{e}_0,\ldots,\textbf{e}_n\)\) is the standard basis 
      			or by specializing the \(\textbf{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\) action to an action of \((\mathbb{C}^*)^{n+1}\). From this
      			second description we immediately see that this act also descends to the Koszul cohomology groups:
      			\[K_{p,q}(n,b;d)=\bigoplus_{\textbf{a}\in\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}}\textbf{k}(\textbf{a})^{\oplus\beta_{p,\textbf{a}}(b;d)},\]
      			where \(\textbf{k}(\textbf{a})\) is the \((\mathbb{C}^*)^{n+1}\)-representation given by 
      			\((z_0,\cdots,z_{n+1})\cdot w=(z_0^{a_0}\cdots z_{n+1}^{a_{n+1}})w.\) We call this the <b>muligraded decomposition</b>
      			of \(K_{p,q}(n,b;d)\) and call the \(\beta_{p,\textbf{a}}(n,d;d)\) the <b>multigraded Betti numbers</b>.

	<p>Note that the multigraded Betti numbers determine both the standard and Schur graded Betti numbers. For example, 
	we can recover the standard graded Betti numbers from the multigraded via the following formula:
	\[
	\beta_{p,q}(n,b;d)=\sum_{|\textbf{a}|=d(p+q)+b}\beta_{p,\textbf{a}}(n,b;d).
	\]
	Recovering the Schur graded Betti numbers is slightly more complicated, but an algorithm for doing so can be found in the
	accompanying paper. Hence the largest part of our computations are focused on computing the multigraded Betti numbers. See
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/approach">Approach</a> page for a discussion of how we go about this.
