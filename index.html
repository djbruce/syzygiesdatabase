title: SyzygyData
description: SyzygyData, a project about computing syzygies.

<div class="container-fluid">

	<p>A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the
Betti table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese
embedding. While the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical
&mdash; the minimal resolution is given by an Eagon-Northcott complex
&mdash; in higher dimensions this problem is almost entirely open. For
example, when \(n=2\), not only is a complete description unknown, but
only a handful of examples have ever been computed. <p class="lead">The
goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high
throughput, distributed computing to systematically gather new examples
of Betti tables of Veronese embeddings of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).
</p>

In general such computations are quite difficult even for relatively
small \(n\) and small \(d\). For instance, when \(n=2\) and \(d\leq 3\),
one can compute the entire Betti table with paper and pencil or
instantly via Macaulay2. Likewise, when \(d=4\), Macaulay2 performed the
computation on a standard laptop in roughly 30 seconds. However, when
\(d=5\), Macaulay2 fails to terminate (as tested on a standard laptop in
2016) , and this case was only recently computed, using alternate
methods, in the 2016 work of Castryck-Cools-Demeyer-Lemmens (available
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08181">here</a>.) The central cause
of difficulty in these computations is that the number of variables
grows on the order of \(O(d^{n})\), and thus the computational
complexity ratchets up dramatically.
</br>
</br>
Our computation is based on the synthesis of known results and the
coordinated execution of many elementary steps. Instead of using
symbolic Gr&ouml;bner methods to compute a free resolution, we use
linear algebra to compute the cohomology of the Koszul complex. 
Separating the Koszul complex into its multigraded strands allows us to
break a (largely infeasible) Gr&ouml;bner computation into a huge number
of more tractable computations.  (See the <a
href="/background">Background</a> page for a more complete description.)
While the theory behind this approach is not new, the only other effort
at implementing on a large scale is the 2016 work
Castryck-Cools-Demeyer-Lemmens.    This is likely because, even for
relatively simple cases, the problem remains quite complicated; the
matrices quickly become massive and numerous. 
</br>
</br>
The crux of our technique is the use of high-speed high-throughput computing to compute
multigraded Betti numbers. This allows us to compute each multigraded Betti number in
parallel, relying on numerical linear algebra algorithms, in particular an LU-decomposition
algorithm. These algorithms are numerical in nature, and so rounding errors may
creep in. However, our primary interest is in the testing and development of conjectures,
so we do not require the precision of symbolic computation. 
See the <a href="/approach">Approach</a> page for a more in-depth description of our methodology.
</br>
</br>
In addition to computing the graded and multigraded Betti numbers, we
also compute the corresponding Schur functor decomposition, which is the
most concise way the syzygy data data.  We also include some auxiliary
statistics, like the number of distinct irreducible representations for
each graded Betti number.
</br>
</br>
Our belief in generating this experimental data is that it will lead to
new conjectures, and verify existing ones, about the syzygies of
Veroneses. See the <a href="/conjectures">Conjectures</a> page for a
list of conjectures and questions we have raised. (Note: Schur functors
methods allow us to catch and correct small rounding errors. See Our
Approach for further description.)
