	<p>A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the Betti
		table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese embedding. While
		the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical &mdash; the minimal resolution is 
		given by an Eagon-Northcott complex &mdash; in higher dimensions this problem remains widely
		open. For example, when \(n=2\) not only is a complete description not known, but only a handful
		of examples have ever been computed.
		</br>
		</br>
		Such computations are made difficult because the number of variables grows rapidly in \(d\). For example,
		with the projective plane the number of variables grows quadratically
		with d. This ratchets up the computational complexity of this question quite quickly. For
		instance, when \(n=2\) and \(d\leq 3\), one can compute the entire Betti table
		with paper and pencil; when \(d\) is 4, Macaulay2 is capable of computing the Betti table
		in around 30 seconds. Yet even when \(d=5\) Macaulay2 fails to terminate.
		</br>
		</br>
		<p class="lead">The goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high speed
		massively distributed computing to systematically gather new examples of the Betti
		tables of Veronese embeddings of projective space, using this data to formulate new conjectures
		and verify existing ones.
		</p>
		
		To achieve this goal we approach the task of computing the Betti numbers is a somewhat
		novel way. In particular, instead of computing the Betti numbers directly we compute a finer invariant:
		the multigraded Betti numbers. From these we are then able to recover both the standard graded Betti numbers, 
		but also the associated Schur functions. The advantage to this approach is twofold:
		<ul>
			<li> First, it moves us from a symbolic algebra to a linear algebra problem, and this allows us to capitalize on some of the incredible technology from numerical linear algebra. </li>
			<li> Second, it breaks the necessary computations up into smaller pieces making it ideal for parallelized and high throughput computing.  </li>
		</ul>
		Currently, we combine sparse, numerical linear
		algebra (via QR and LU factorization algorithms) with high throughput, and high
		performance computing (via HTCondor) to implement this method effectively. (See 
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/approach">Our Approach</a> page for a more in-depth description of our methodology.)
		</br>
		</br>
		While others [1] have recently implemented similar ideas regarding the computation of graded Betti numbers, our approach has a few additional benefits,
		one being the Schur function data. As \(d\) increases the graded and multigraded Betti numbers of the Veronese embedding grow quickly, becoming so large and numerous as to be difficult to work with. 
		In particular, the size of the individual Betti numbers &mdash; in the hundreds of millions &mdash; obscures much of the underlying structure and patterns. However, packaging this data via the associated Schur functions, 
		makes the data easier to work with. This has allowed us to (conjecturally) glimpse some of the underlying structure of these syzygies.
		</br>
		</br>
		Our belief in generating this experimental data  is that it will lead to new conjectures about the syzygies of Veroneses. (See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/conjectures">Conjectures</a> page for a list of conjectures and questions we have raised.) 
		Thus we are content working with numerical algorithms, despite the potential for accidentally rounding a minuscule value down to zero. Throughout, we try to clearly differentiate between the
		Betti numbers that have been computed symbolically (e.g. by Gr&ouml;obner
		basis algorithms) from those that were computed numerically. (Note: Our Schur function methods allow us to catch and correct most small rounding errors. See Our Approach for further description.)
