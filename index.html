<div class="container-fluid">

	<p>A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the Betti
		table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese embedding. While
		the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical &mdash; the minimal resolution is 
		given by an Eagon-Northcott complex &mdash; in higher dimensions this problem remains widely
		open. For example, when \(n=2\) not only is a complete description not known, but only a handful
		of examples have ever been computed.
		
		<p class="lead">The goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high speed
		massively distributed computing to systematically gather new examples of the Betti
		tables of Veronese embeddings of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).
		</p>

		Such computations are made difficult because the number of variables grows on the order of \(O(d^{n})\). 
		This means the computational complexity ratchets up quite dramatically
		are well highlight by the case when \(n=2\). For example, with the projective plane the number of variables grows quadratically
		with d. This ratchets up the computational complexity of this question quite quickly. For
		instance, when \(n=2\) and \(d\leq 3\), one can compute the entire Betti table
		with paper and pencil; when \(d\) is 4, Macaulay2 is capable of computing the Betti table
		in around 30 seconds. Yet even when \(d=5\) Macaulay2 fails to terminate.
		</br>
		</br>
		So to achieve our goal we approach the task of computing Betti numbers is a somewhat
		novel fashion. First we take the task of computing Betti tables and break it in a way that
		boils down to computing the ranks of a large number of matrices. This in itself is not new, 
		and the resulting problem is still quite daunting. (See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/background">Background</a> page for a more complete description.)
		</br>
		</br>
		Second we create a framework to systematically perform such computations making use of high 
		speed distributed computing and highly efficient sparse matrix algorithms. In large part the 
		novelty of this project lies in this execution. (See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/approach">Our Approach</a> page for a more in-depth description of our methodology.)
		</br>
		</br>
		While others [1] have recently implemented similar ideas regarding the computation of graded Betti numbers, our approach has a few additional benefits,
		one being the Schur function data. As \(d\) increases the graded and multigraded Betti numbers of the Veronese embedding grow quickly, becoming so large and numerous as to be difficult to work with. 
		In particular, the size of the individual Betti numbers &mdash; in the hundreds of millions &mdash; obscures much of the underlying structure and patterns. However, packaging this data via the associated Schur functions, 
		makes the data easier to work with. This has allowed us to (conjecturally) glimpse some of the underlying structure of these syzygies.
		</br>
		</br>
		Our belief in generating this experimental data  is that it will lead to new conjectures about the syzygies of Veroneses. (See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/conjectures">Conjectures</a> page for a list of conjectures and questions we have raised.) 
		Thus we are content working with numerical algorithms, despite the potential for accidentally rounding a minuscule value down to zero. Throughout, we try to clearly differentiate between the
		Betti numbers that have been computed symbolically (e.g. by Gr&ouml;obner
		basis algorithms) from those that were computed numerically. (Note: Our Schur function methods allow us to catch and correct most small rounding errors. See Our Approach for further description.)
