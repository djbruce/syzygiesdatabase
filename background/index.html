	Fix \(n>0\) and let \(S=\textbf{k}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]\) be the standard graded polynomial ring. We denote
	the \(k\)th graded piece of \(S\) by \(S_k\). Now for any \(b\in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(d\in\mathbb{N}\) we let
	\[ S(b;d):= \bigoplus_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}S_{dk+b}\subset S\]
	which we think of as an \(R=\text{Sym}(S_d)\)-module. Notice that \(S(b;d)\) corresponds to the pushforward of the 
	sheaf \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(b)\) by the \(d\)'uple embedding of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).

	</p>
	Understanding the Betti numbers of \(S(b;d)\) amounts, in essence, to understanding \(\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\textbf{k})\)
	as a graded \(R\)-module. Usually by "graded" one means the \(\mathbb{Z}\) these \(\text{Tor}\) modules inherit from the 
	standard grading on \(S\). However, in our work there turns out to be three different, although related, gradings we find it
	fruitful to consider. We briefly describe each below:

	As mentioned above \(\text{Tor}^R(S(b;d),\textbf{k})\) inherits a natural \(\mathbb{Z}\)-grading from the
	standard grading on \(S\). This gives rise to the<b>standard graded Betti number</b> of \(S(b;d)\) which one may define by:
	\[\beta_{p,q}(S(b;d)):=\dim_{\bf{k}}\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\textbf{k})_{q}.\]
	Note while this notation is quite standard, for easy of notation as well as other applications 
	it is often easier to work with the <b> Koszul cohomology groups</b> of \(S(b;d)\), which are defined to be:
	\[K_{p,q}(S(b;d))=\text{Tor}_{p}^{R}(S(b;d),\textbf{k})_{p+q}.\]
	Notice knowing these Koszul cohomology groups is equivalent to know the standard graded
	Betti numbers since \(\dim K_{p,q}(S(b;d))\) is equal to \(\beta_{p,p+q}(S(b;d))\). The (graded)

      			The polynomial ring \(S\) carries an action of the general linear group \(\textbf{GL}_{n+1}(\textbf{k})\), which

      			This grading descends to \(\Tor^{R}(S(b;d),\textbf{k})\). Moreover, since this action is degree preserving this grading

		<p>Recall that we can think of a grading of a ring/module as a decomposition into irreducible 
		representations arising from some group action. For example, the standard grading on \(S\)
